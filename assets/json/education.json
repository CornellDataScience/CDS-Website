    "description" : "Data Science (CDS) is an undergraduate project team which builds data-driven solutions to a variety of real-world problems. Current initiatives range from devising a scalable mapping system for better natural disaster response to developing a tool that can summarize Amazon reviews for a better user experience. Our team of 70+ students is a great place to meet people with diverse interests, gain experience at the intersection of theory and application, and contribute to the greater community initiatives.",
