By using the lens of data visualization to better examine food waste, the outcome of this research can serve to help education campaigns surrounding food waste, as well as help local grocery stores understand the role they play in the food waste management pipeline. This research will provide insights into the key elements needed in data visualizations for managing food waste. ",

            "text": "Motivated by the inconvenience of not being able to use facial recognition software to unlock our phones while wearing masks, we set out to build a model that could accurately recognize one's face while partially obstructed by a mask. Namely, this required recognizing the upper portion of the subject's face while everything below the nose and along the chin was covered. To do so, we preprocessed a dataset of 13,000 people and correctly drew masks on all of them (coloring over their nose, mouth, and along their jawline with a solid blue). Then, we built and trained a Siamese Network using these matched pictures, ultimately leading to our final product, which will allow the user to select two images from the dataset and determine whether or not the two images portray the same person.",

The project had three main sections: getting the top moves for a position from an engine, making a GUI with features such as the chessboard, drawing arrows, and highlighting squares, and then connecting these parts by getting the information from the engine and using that as inputs for GUI visualizations. The GUI can take in a FEN string, which represents a specific game state, and displays the new position on the board. On this new position, it generates arrows to show the best moves and responses, shows a heatmap of which squares are more active, and displays the top move sequences with their probabilities. Overall, these features are meant to give the user different visual insights into what the engine thinks about the position.",
