    "title" : "Team Overview",
    "description" : "Our team is made up of 92 members and works on many areas of machine learning and data science. As a result, we have a total of four subteams: Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, Data Engineering, and Quantitative Finance, each with their own primary area of focus.",
    "subtitle" : "Executive Board",
    "subdescription" : "Cornell Data Science is more than just a project team â€“ we also teach courses, lead educational initiatives, and invest in the exploration of new frontiers.  For this reason, we have an executive board which manages our general operations and several subteams which lead our technical direction. Our focus is on building a strong and diverse data science community for undergraduates.  We work closely with university administration, professors, and companies to prepare students for the information age.",

Our work ranges from natural language processing to computer vision and reinforcement learning. Examples of current efforts include automatic question answering, Poker / Wordle / Smash Bros playing bots, and Arxiv PDF math formula searching. We are proud of our robust educational series and our course, INFO 1998: Intro to Data Science. To keep up with the latest research we also hold biweekly paper reading groups and publish paper summaries on our blog.",
