    "description" : "Our team is made up of 80+ members and works on many areas of machine learning and data science. As a result, we have a total of five subteams: Intelligent Systems, Insights, Data Engineering, Algorithmic Trading, and Education, each with their own primary area of focus.",
    "subtitle" : "Executive Board",
    "subdescription" : "Cornell Data Science is more than just a project team â€“ we also teach courses, lead educational initiatives, and invest in the exploration of new frontiers.  For this reason, we have an executive board which manages our general operations and several subteams which lead our technical direction. Our focus is on building a strong and diverse data science community for undergraduates.  We work closely with university administration, professors, and companies to prepare students for the information age.",

Our work ranges from natural language processing to computer vision.  Examples of current efforts include automatic question answering and scalable map generation for unmapped communities using object detection and IBM Research infrastructure.",

In general, we want to find a portfolio of stocks and buy/sell them in such a way that we long (or buy) at a lower price, and short (or sell) at a higher one. More specifically, we are applying statistical techniques to determine what equities to trade, and machine learning techniques to determine when it is appropriate to enter or exit a position. Of course, PnL (Profit and Loss) drives the business of trading, so our goal is to essentially have an algorithm that maximizes profit while not exposing ourselves to too much risk.",
