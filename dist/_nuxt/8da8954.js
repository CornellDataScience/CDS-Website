Our work always has a strong outreach/user focus and a strong connection to machine learning. In addition to our numerous projects each semester, we also have weekly paper presentations where several members present a recent, or interesting paper to the rest of the subteam followed by a discussion. We also have a few tech talks throughout the semester which are lecture style talks on a useful topic related to ML. In the past this has ranged from an introduction to cloud computing, and a lecture on contextual bandits.","current":[{"title":"Smash AI","text":"Using reinforcement learning to training AI\'s for Super Smash Bros.

However, how these models use feature information is often unclear, making them poorly suited for seeking to understand our world. On the other hand, simple linear models are prevalent through research due to their simple inference, yet make highly unrealistic assumptions.

Fairmandering is made possible by a recent breakthough in redistricting technology. The basic idea is to repeatedly break up a state into smaller regions such that the pieces can fit together in an exponential number of ways. It is then efficient to filter out the thousands of fair maps from the trillions we create.\\"","link":"https://fairmandering.org/index.html"},{"title":"Forage","text":"Forage is a platform for analyzing and forecasting urban trends with a focus on housing.

While everyone on the planet is hit with the same kinds of disasters, to say that they are affected equally is negligent. In third world countries, some of whom might have poor cartographical systems of infrastructure, the problems of something like a hurricane is exacerbated by their physical inability to manage the wreckage. People are lost in the destruction, and with poor local mapping finding ways of navigating wreckage is infeasible. Introduce AIR. The AIR project is dedicated to enabling lower-income areas with efficient and automated mapping based on satellite or drone imagery. We have trained numerous deep learning models for translating images to class maps, where anyone can see where the roads, buildings, and other features are. Furthermore, our access to a large amount of different topological landscapes means we could train our models in different areas, and for specific instances of disasters the model that matches that topological area will perform the best rather than a one size fits all. Finally, we have built-in functionality for incorporating public access drone imagery in our model and have found success both for using that in the \'class-map\' predictions, as well as a \'difference\' heatmap that can show what areas of a map are most affected.","link":"https://github.com/Dieblitzen/AIR-Project"},{"title":"Amazon Review Summarization: Clustering and autoencoders for review distillation","text":"Evaluating potential purchases online is often made easier by reviews provided by other customers.
